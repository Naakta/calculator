# calculator

Built by Douglas Wagner

Basic calculator with intro functionality. 

**Current Functionality**
-Single Operator Equations (ex. 3 + 5 = 8 -> reset for new equation, starting at a new first operand)  
-All Clear  
-Positive/Negative toggle  
-Multiplication  
-Division  
-Addition  
-Subtraction  
-Squared  
-Square Root  
-Percent  
-Integers and Decimals represented properly (ex. 2 x 10.0 = 20.0 will be shown as 20)  
-AutoLayout: utilized same width, and same height feature  


**Planned Functionality**
-Multiple operator equations (ex. input: 3 + 5 + 2 = 10)  
-More operators (userdefined power, userdefined radical, log, cos, sin, tan, etc...)  
-Separate layout for landscape orientation  
-Clear (just the current operand, instead of entire equation)
